  <h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update</h2>
  <p>Curtin University is committed to supporting all our students and staff whether they are on campus, working
    remotely or overseas. Your health, safety and wellbeing are our priority and the continuing COVID-19 pandemic
    may require changes to the unit schedule, learning activities, delivery modes and assessment to provide flexible
    and safe options to our community. Curtin will endeavour to keep changes and disruptions to a minimum at all
    times. For current advice and further information visit https://www.curtin.edu.au/novel-coronavirus/.</p>

  <h2>Syllabus</h2>
  <p>The study of Web application development; examine web technologies, alternative web development
    methodologies and evaluate various code libraries and tools.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate
    technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the
    structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's
    behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business
    context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify
    stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible webbased
    applications.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>Unit Learning Outcomes</h2>
  <p>All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These
    inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
    and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the
    Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process
    referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
    understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
    designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of
    the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.
    Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities
    through the assurance of learning processes in each unit.</p>

  <h2>Assesment Moderation</h2>
  <h3>Fair assessment through moderation</h3>
    <p>Moderation describes a quality assurance process to ensure that assessments are appropriate to the learning
    outcomes, and that students work is evaluated consistently by assessors. Minimum standards for the moderation
    of assessments are described in the Assessment and Student Progression Manual, available from <a href="policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/">policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/</a>
    </p><br>
  <h3>Pre-marking moderation</h3>
    <p>A co-assessor is assigned to this unit to review all assessment tasks and marking criteria/rubrics and monitor and
    confirm the integrity of results. Assessment tasks are provided to students before the assessment task, marking
    criteria are provided to students, assessors are provided with marking guides/rubrics and sufficient information to
    ensure fair and consistent evaluation of student work.</p><br>
  <h3>Intra-marking / Post-marking moderation</h3>
    <p>The following intra-marking / post-marking moderation practices are planned for use in this unit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Second marking of student work samples near grade boundaries</li>
      <li>Second marking of borderline student work; or a process of review and validation of decisions where
      students have not met the pass requirements</li>
      <li>Analysis of the variances between markers and locations</li>
      <li>Second marking of a random sample to check for consistent application of marking criteria and standards</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Late assessment</h3>
    <p>Where the submission of a late assessment is permitted, late penalties will be consistently applied in this unit.
    Where a late assessment is permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the Assessment
    Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>For assessment items submitted within the first 24 hours after the due date/time, students will be penalised
      by a deduction of 5% of the total marks allocated for the assessment task;</li>
      <li>For each additional 24 hour period commenced an additional penalty of 10% of the total marks allocated
      for the assessment item will be deducted; and</li>
      <li>Assessment items submitted more than 168 hours late (7 calendar days) will receive a mark of zero.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Where late assessment is <b>NOT</b> permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the
      Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will receive a mark of zero.</li>

      <h3>Reasonable adjustments for students with disabilities/health circumstances likely to impact on
      studies</h3>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/students/personal-support/disability/cap/">Curtin Access Plan</a> (CAP) is a document that outlines the type and level of support required by a student with a
      disability or health condition to have equitable access to their studies at Curtin. Carers for people with disability
      may also be eligible for support. This support can include alternative exam or test arrangements, study materials
      in accessible formats, access to Curtin's facilities and services or other support as discussed with an advisor from
      <a href="http://bit.ly/accessability-curtin">AccessAbility Services.</a></p>
      <p>Documentation is required from your treating Health Professional to confirm your health circumstances or carer
      responsibilities.</p>
      <p>If you think you may be eligible for a CAP, please contact AccessAbility Services. If you already have a CAP please
      provide it to the Unit Coordinator in week 1 of each study period.</p>
