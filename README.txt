I spent roughly less than 24 culmulative hours in total completing the website.

I mostly used w3school to identify which tags i needed such as the <hr> tag for horizontal lines.

I collaborated with no one but did get feedback from my lecturers.

The very first section of my website has a lot of break line tags because i was attempting to use
grids but had an issue aligning the content on the left grid to the content n the right grid.
Other than that i have been able to completely implement everthing.
